## About

The programs in this repository cover a range of topics taught during the first-semester C programming lab. These include basic input/output operations, control structures, loops, functions, arrays, pointers, and other foundational concepts in C.

This repository serves as a reference for anyone who wants to:

- Learn basic C programming.
- Understand how common programming problems are solved.

## Programs

Here are some topics and types of programs included:

- **Basic Input/Output:** Simple programs using `scanf` and `printf`.
- **Control Structures:** `if-else`, `switch-case`, etc.
- **Loops:** Iterative structures such as `for`, `while`, and `do-while`.
- **Functions:** Programs demonstrating user-defined and standard library functions.
- **Arrays and Strings:** Operations like searching, sorting, and manipulation.
- **Pointers:** Basics of memory management and pointer arithmetic.
- **Structures:** Introduction to user-defined data types.
  
You can check the individual program files in the repository for more details.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yuvii-b/CS23C04_Lab.git
   cd CS23C04_Lab
   ```

2. Compile a program using `gcc`:
   ```bash
   gcc program_name.c -o program_name
   ```

3. Run the compiled program:
   ```bash
   ./program_name
   ```

Ensure you have a C compiler like GCC installed on your system.
